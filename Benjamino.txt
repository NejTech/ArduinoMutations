The Benjamino is basicly a customization of the Sanguino (Arduino with ATmega644) into
the conventional format for easy USB interface, shields, power etc. Has 32 pins in total.
Once again, the power switching is wrong, but this time it's the MOSFET being connected
the wrong way. Created February 2011
