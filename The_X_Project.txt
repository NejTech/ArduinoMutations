The X Project was quite an ambitious design, utilising an ATXmega MCU, more specifically the Xmega16A4
in an Arduino-style board. Introducing 12 analog input pins (32 in total) and whopping five UART ports.
Unfourtunately 3.3V only but packing a DAC and abeefy 32MHz crystal, it would have been a fun board.
It's a shame I don't have the skills to write the software for it... Atleast this time I think the
power circuitry is fine, for there is no op-amp to misunderstand. Created April 2011
