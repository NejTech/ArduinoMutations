The USBduino Max was supposed to be the Arduino Mega for the USBduino while keeping the standard
Arduino footprint. It uses the AT90USB1286- MCU and packs amazing 46 pins and twin voltage regulators
for more 5V power. Once again, the power switching part with the op-amp is probably wrong. Created March 2011
