The USBduino is a board I just had to throw together when I heard about the (back then new) ATmega32u4 MCU...
Yes, I am aware that there is now an official Arduino board with this MCU, but keep in mind that this was made
in March 2011. Originally intended to use the LUFA CDC bootloader. Note: I the power selector part of the schematic 
is probably wrong. Created March 2011
